.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command line interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.br
.B echo "command" | hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B hsh
program is a simple shell written in C. It provides a minimal environment to execute commands, handle built ins, and resolve executables using the PATH environment variable.

The shell works in both interactive and non interactive modes. In interactive mode, it displays a prompt and waits for user input. In non interactive mode, it reads commands from standard input.

.SH FEATURES
Executes commands with arguments.
.br
Handles absolute and relative paths.
.br
Searches for executables in the PATH environment variable.
.br
Provides proper error handling. If a command is not found, it prints:
.br
\fB./hsh: 1: command: not found\fR
and returns exit status 127.
.br
Works with empty PATH or unset PATH variables.

.SH BUILTINS
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell. No arguments are handled.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment, one variable per line.
